# Introduction
We proudly present to you Glints Aries made by Front End Engineers of Glints. It is a Frontend framework to simplify and speed up your development. This project rebuilt with React and Styled Components. We are still actively develop this project day by day. So there are still a ton of amazing components to be built.

## Installation
```bash
npm install -S glints-aries
```

## Basic usage
Import the component into your file.
```bash
import { ... } from 'glints-aries'
```

Before you start implementing the component, it's always a good start to always wrap your root component with <GlintsContainer />.
We created that Container to adapt with every screen sizes, so Users will always have best experience whenever they visit your site from their devices.
GlintsContainer also consists global style of glints-aries, so that it becomes a complement to the components.
For more details, you can read this at Utilities, then GlintsContainer section.
```bash
import { GlintsContainer } from 'glints-aries'

<GlintsContainer>
  <Component />
</GlintsContainer>
```

## Code structure in glints-aries
1. Always do alphabetically when importing file.
2. Put file on proper folder based on each respective uses.
3. Use 2 Indent Spaces and Tab on the code.
4. Follow this import structure for your code
   - First: always import **React** library at first.
   - Second: third-party.
   - Third: glints-aries component.
   - Fourth: glints-aries utilities.
   - Fifth: styling.
```bash
import React from 'react'; // React

import classNames from 'classnames'; // Third-party
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; // Third-party

import Modal from '../../Display/Modal'; // Glints Aries component

import { escEvent } from '../../Utils/DomUtils'; // Glints Aries utilities

import { Container, ModalBackground, ModalArea } from '../../Style/ModalStyle'; // Styling
```
Always give line break between different section when importing.

6. Always do line break whenever your import or variable is so long.

You can do it like this but you can do it in another format as long as it can be legible and not long

const {
  type,
  children,
  className,
  ...defaultProps
 } = this.props;

## Code procedure in glints-aries
1. Use Color library instead of writing hex color.
```bash
background-color: #EC272B; // Wrong
background-color: ${PrimaryColor.glintsred}; // Right
```

2. Use Device Size instead of writing pixel size number.
```bash
@media (max-width: 600px) { ... } // Wrong
@media ${Device.mobileL} { ... } //Right
```

3. For styling always use the component name followed by the role of that style.
```bash
CheckboxContainer
1. Checkbox is name of the component.
2. Container is outer part of the component.

JobcardImageWrapper
1. Jobcard is name of the component.
2. ImageWrapper is wrapper of the image inside Job Card.

```bash
<Collapsible onHoverColor="#FAFAFA" /> // Wrong
```

5. Most of the time use **em** and **rem**, but still can use **px** for fixed dimension.
6. Don't create to many element nodes inside the Component. Always do it in a simple way.
```bash
  // Wrong
  <div className="container">
    <div className="wrapper">
      <div>
        <h1>This is Heading</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
